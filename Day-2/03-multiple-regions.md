# Multiple Region Implementation in Terraform

You can make use of `alias` keyword to implement multi region infrastructure setup in
terraform.
alias keyword is only necessary when you need to use multiple configurations of the same provider, such as managing resources in multiple regions. For single-region or single-configuration setups, it is not required.

```
provider "aws" {
  alias = "us-east-1"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias = "us-west-2"
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  provider = "aws.us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example2" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  provider = "aws.us-west-2"
}
```
